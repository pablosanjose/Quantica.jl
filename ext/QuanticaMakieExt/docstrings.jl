    qplot(object; figure = (;), axis = (;), fancyaxis = true, inspector = true, plotkw...)

Render a plot of `object` using the `Makie` package. Supported `object`s and associated
specialized plot recipes:

- `object::Lattice`             -> `plotlattice` (supports also `LatticeSlice`s)
- `object::Hamiltonian`         -> `plotlattice` (supports also `ParametricHamiltonian`)
- `object::GreenFunction`       -> `plotlattice` (supports also `OpenHamiltonian`, see below)
- `object::Bandstructure`       -> `plotbands`   (supports also slices of `Bandstructure`)
- `object::Subband`             -> `plotbands`   (supports also collections of `Subbands`)

Supported `Makie` backends include `GLMakie`, `CairoMakie`, `WGLMakie`, etc. Instead of
`using Makie`, load a specific backend directly, e.g. `using GLMakie`.

    qplot(g::Union{GreenFunction,OpenHamiltonian}; children = (plotkw₁::NamedTuple, plotkw₂::NamedTuple, ...), kw...)

Render the parent Hamiltonian of `g`, along with a representation of each of `g`'s
self-energies. Specific `plotkwᵢ` keywords for each self-energy can be given in `children`,
cycling over them if necessary.

## Keywords

- `figure`: keywords to pass onto the plot `Figure` (e.g. `size` or `fontsize`, see `Makie.Figure`)
- `axis`: keywords to pass on to the plot axis (see `Makie.LScene`, `Makie.Axis3` or `Makie.Axis` for options)
- `fancyaxis::Bool`: for 3D plots, whether to use `Makie.LScene` (supports zoom+pan) instead of `Makie.Axis3`
- `inspector::Bool`: whether to enable interactive tooltips of plot elements
- `plotkw`: additional keywords to pass on to `plotlattice` or `plotbands`, see their docstring for details.

    qplotdefaults(; figure = missing, axis2D = missing, axis3D = missing, lscene = missing, inspector = missing)

Define default values for the `figure` and `axis` keyword arguments of `qplot`. The `axis2D`
defaults are applied to `axis` for 2D plots, while `lscene` or `axis3D` are applied to
`axis` if `fancyaxis` is `true` or `false`, respectively. Similarly, the `inspector`
defaults are passed to `DataInspector` if tooltips are activated.

    qplotdefaults(defaults::NamedTuple)

Equivalent to `qplotdefaults(; defaults...)`
